## Summary

Analysis of the Bike Sharing data from New York shows that most customers checkout the bikes for an optimal time of 5 minutes. This data will be helpful to determine the number of bikes needed as inventory. 

Looking at the Top_Starting_Location and Top_Ending_Location gives an idea as to how the bikes have to be distributed over different ride share stations. The more frequented spots should have more bikes available at the busiest time.

The August_Peak_Hours visualization gives an idea of the busiest time of the day. All bike maintenance decisions can be made to avoid the busy time.

Additional analysis :-

* Analysis can be done to see the imapct of age with the use of the bike sharing program. This could influence the marketing team to cater to the age group most likely to use this program in the future.

* Analysis can also be done to find the most used bike so that maintenance can be scheduled after a predetermined time to keep them working in optimal condition.
